Draw a geometric image based on this description: BA is perpendicular to CA, AC=12, AB=16.
Draw a geometric image based on this description: DE=2, DF=3, E bisects segment CD, ABCD is a parallelogram. In the diagram, there is a parallelogram labeled ABCD, with points A, B, C, and D as its vertices. Point E is the midpoint of the side CD. The extended lines of AD and BE intersect at point F.
Draw a geometric image based on this description: \u2220ABC=90\u00b0, \u2220BCD=1/2\u2220ABC, \u2220DAB=90\u00b0. The diagram consists of a quadrilateral ABCD. Points A, B, C, and D are the vertices of the quadrilateral. Angle A is equal to angle B, and both are twice the measure of angle C. There is an angle C. The degree measure of angle D can be determined by subtracting the sum of angles A, B, and C from 360 degrees.
Draw a geometric image based on this description: \u2220ABC=90\u00b0, \u2220BCD=1/2\u2220ABC, \u2220DAB=90\u00b0. In the diagram, we have a quadrilateral labeled ABCD with vertices A, B, C, and D. Angle A is equal to angle B, and both are twice the measure of angle C. There is also a right angle labeled as angle C.
